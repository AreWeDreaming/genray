======================
RWH, Dec/2012.


GENRAY is an all frequencies ray tracing code incorporating
a wide range of plasma dispersion functions.  The basic
coordinate system is R,Phi,Z cylindrical coordinates and
plasma parameters vary as a function of toroidal flux surface
coordinates, although there are some facilities for
non-axisymmetric density and temperatures.   It is open source,
as described in the preamble of genray.f.

Due to time available, developers can answer a very limited
number of questions on the use of these codes.  In general,
CompX obtains support funds for instructions, applications,
additions to GENRAY (and other CompX codes).

GENRAY is written in fortran, and is compiled with the open 
software libraries for netCDF, and pgPLOT.  The developers
use the gfortran compiler.

Simple visualization is provided by xdraw (xdraw1 is name of 
the executable produced by make, as with xdraw_081202.tar.gz.  We
alias name xdraw to xdraw1).   xdraw should compile on any 
Linux or UNIX machines, with c and X-windows.
See tests file in the 00_Regression_Tests dir for tests.
You will also need an MPI library, if you want a parallelized
execution.
RWH makes the genray executable using gmake 
(make -f makefile_gfortran64) under Linux.
SAP (and more recently, Yuri Petrov, CompX) uses a Microsoft
environment.
There is also a makefile_nowrite_gfortran64, which greatly
reduces the debug data going to the screen.
makefile_mpi.gfortran64 appears to be latest MPI version, but
this might need a little work.
The wide range of other makefiles indicate a past history 
of compile and load with other compilers and computers,
some of which may need their sources lists updated.
Namelist input specifies the particular code runs.  The
input namelist file must be named genray.dat (for a mixed
physics units system) and genray.in (for an almost pure
MKSA units, except temperatures are in keV).  The genray.in
file is used, if the genray.dat file does not exist in the
excution directory.  A description of the namelist inputs is
maintained in the genray.dat_template_to_120401 and
genray.in_template_MKSA_120401, or similarly named files, where
the 120401 is the date of last update.  These *template*
files are the main documentation of code input, and are 
kept current.

For most applications, genray also requires an "eqdsk"
which specifies the 2D plasma flux surfaces in a 
poloidal cross-section.

Simple visualization is provided by xdraw (xdraw1 is name of 
the executable produced by make, as with xdraw_081202.tar.gz.  We
alias name xdraw to xdraw1).   xdraw should compile on any 
Linux or UNIX machines, with c and X-windows.
See tests file in the 00_Regression_Tests dir for tests.

Most relevant ray data is output to the netCDF file genray.nc.
This provides an additional means of visualization of the
results, using, for example, matplotlib in the python language.
Various netCDF file viewers are also available on the internet.

You will also need an MPI library, if you want a parallelized
execution.

RWH makes the genray executable using gmake 
(make -f makefile_gfortran64) under Linux (specifically, CentOS6).
SAP (and more recently, Yuri Petrov, CompX) uses a Microsoft
environment.
There is also a makefile_nowrite_gfortran64, which greatly
reduces the (often overwhelming amount of) debug data going
to the screen.

makefile_mpi.gfortran64 appears to be latest MPI makefile
version, but this might need a little work.
The wide range of other makefiles indicate a past history 
of compile and load with other compilers and computers,
some of which may need their sources lists updated.

Some familiarity with the code can be developed by running
the regression tests (in subdirectory 00_Genray_Regression_Tests).
See README therein, and execute the statements in ./tests

A brief description of the code is can also be found at 
http://www.compxco.com/genray.html

The main physics reference is Genray_manual-2001-1-V2_110416.pdf
available at http://www.compxco.com/genray.html.
Additional functionality has been added since the March 17, 2003
document, as can be seen in the a_change.i file which keeps
track of bug fixes and code additions.

ls -lt make_archive/* gives a sort of history of the compilers and computers
with which genray has been compiled, including dates.  The newer ones
will work with the present distribution.
