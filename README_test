/home/bobh/cql3d/git_genray/README_test

This is a test file for adding file to git working directory.

git add README_test
get status shows it is in staged state.
Modify it further (now).
git status ==> it is in Changes to be committed list,
               and is modified. .#README_test is an untracked file.

Got rid of  .#README_test (emacs releted) by saving it.
Now git status ==> Changed but not updated:  modified:   README_test
Do git add README_test ==> # Changes to be committed: modified:   README_test
