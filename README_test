This is a test file for adding file to git working directory.

git add README_test
get status shows it is in staged state.
Modify it further (now).
git status ==> it is in Changes to be committed list,
               and is modified. .#README_test is an untracked file.

Got rid of  .#README_test (emacs releted) by saving it.
Now git status ==> Changed but not updated:  modified:   README_test
Do git add README_test ==> # Changes to be committed: modified:   README_test
git commit -a -m 'More README_tests' ==> works [Wouldn't work without the
   -m '<Message>'
Making further mods, and saving.
Then,
git checkout README_test ==> overwrites changed README in working directory.
                             I updated the checkout file. added and 
                             committed.


Making copy of the directory and sub-directories.  Then comparing these
directories with the copy with bcompare, after  commiting this 
README_test file.  Purpose: to see what is changed througout the
directories.
