The xdraw code was constructed by Sheryl M. Glasser.
The make utility gives the executable xdraw1, which
is then linked to xdraw.

Usage is
xdraw xxxx
where xxxx is one of the drawxxxx.in files in
the xdraw_input/ directory.

xdraw plots data which is output by the genray
code into *.bin files.   The drawxxxx.in file
specifies the input file and the quantities 
which are to be plotted.
