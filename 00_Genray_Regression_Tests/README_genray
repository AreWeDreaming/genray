00_TEST_SUITE/

July 17, 2007
=============

This directory is for suite of short test input
files.
Adjust the script tests for the XGENRAY version to be tested.
Execute the script:
time ./tests 2>&1 |tee log_tests
creates 7 test subdirectories and, with xdraw, plots
results plus displays the same plots for a previous
version of genray for comparison.
Should take .le.10 minutes total for the 5 tests.


Test 1:
=======
Shortened (nfreq=5) X-mode perp viewing ECE (G Taylor work).
Inputs: genray.dat_SS_Xmode_180_emission Scen4_bn2.57_129x129
bob5:/home/bobh/cql3d/iter_ECE_pppl_No2/SS/Xmode/180/genray_v6-0_test
Takes 50 CPU seconds. [2.4 GHz Xeon]
1m23s on bob8, with genray_v7-8_080801.
1m32s on compx1, with genray_v7-11_081007

View in test1/ with xdraw, and compare with xdraw*.ps in ./:
xdraw genr   [check vs xdraw_genr_SS_Xmode_180_emission.ps]
xdraw em     [check vs xdraw_em_SS_Xmode_180_emission.ps]
These .ps files were generate from run with
/home/bobh/cql3d/genray/genray_cvs/code/gr070121/xgenray

You can also .run idl_emission_spectrum_colorbar.pro to get
specrum of emission at the plasma edge vs energy of emitting
electrons, assuming IDL paths set up OK.

OXB ray into NSTX.
Zooming in on xdraw freqelec plots, shows radii where frqncy=16.5 GHz is equal
to fpe[curve 0, green], X-mode cutuff fx1[8, purple], and fuh[2, yellow].

Test7:
======
Uses updated (Mar. 2, 2009) MKSA genray.in_CMod_LH_edge namelist file.
Five ray LH test run for C-Mod.  Rays propagate beyond the
LCFS into density and temperature specified by exponential
fall-off distance beyond LCFS.  The fall-off distance for
density varies with poloidal angle.  Rays reflect from the
vacuum vessel.

Takes 17.4 secs.

Test7_edge_dens_rz
==================
C-Mod LH test case using new i_edge_dens_rz_mesh=1 and 2 options,
for which a first genray run creates a template file (=1) of plasma
density/temperature based on namelist input.  File is called
dens_temp_rz_out.dat.  This file can be modified to produce
arbitrary toroidally symmetric density profiles beyond the LCFS,
using external software.  Here we simply rename
the file to dens_temp_rz_in.dat (through a soft link), and use it
as input for i_edge_dens_rz_mesh=2.  Comparisons are made with the
saved ray plots, and with test7 ray data which was produced without
using the dens_temp_rz_out.dat/dens_temp_rz_in.dat files, giving
slightly different rays.
test7.mpi
=========
Put test 7 files in ./test7.mpi
Run with mpi using edison_batchscript_mpi.slurm, as described in that file.
#This run takes full time: 22.45 secs.   To be compared with serial version
#  which takes 58.2 secs.   Since parallelization is over rays, then the
#  execution time for the mpi version is controlled by the ray which takes
#  the longest time.


Test8:
======
Near central ECCD in ITER.  Test case to be compared with Fig. 12
of R. Prater et al., Nucl. Fus. 48 (2008) 035006 (11pp), benchmarking
paper.  The genray results here are obtained with the ADJ-QL code,
adapted from the original ADJ analytic equilibria, model RF fluxes
to apply here to numerical equilibria and using QL fluxes calculated
from the ray data.  The calculation is momentum conserving, which
increases current about  10-11 kA/MW to
toroidal_cur_total = 25809.27080280 A for 1MW, versus cql3d finds 24.0 kA/MW
CPU time =1.25910D+03 secs (=21.0 min).
If the adj calculation is turned off (i_calculate_or_read_adj_function =0) 
the ray and CD calculation takes 13.5 secs.  But the saved adjout/adjinp
files for the adj calc total 181 MB, so the full test is carried out.
CD data is compared with Prater et al results, and with previous code
run.

Nicola Bertelli (2014-07-16) added momentum conservation ieffic_mom_cons=1
into ieffic=4 Lin_Liu (TorGA_curgap subroutine), according to
Marushchenko et al, NF 48, 054002 (2008).  BH added to 00_Regression_Tests,
test8.1-3, giving results as follows:

test	   descrptn				Comp. time		Curr(kA)
test8      i_adj=1 ADJ-bases self adjoint,	2m52s with adj calc	25.8
           momentum conserving.	  		4s, existing adj calc in adjout
test8.1	   ieffic=4, ieffic_mom_cons=1		0.60s			25.5
test8.2	   ieffic=4, ieffic_mom_cons=0		0.60s			13.0
test8.3	   ieffic=3, Curba (Cohen) subroutine 	0.59s			10.1
	   (high vel approx, sq-well-B)
Definitely, test8.1 setup is preferable for this type of run.	

Test9:
======

This test compares application of the LSC-like QL calc of damping on 
a Maxwellian, with a second pass through the damping with the QL plateau
turned on, versus poloidal distance along the ray. 
Thus, compare genray.bin_CMod_LH_edge_LSC with test7/genray.bin using xdraw.
The single run produces plots of QL damping on Maxwellian as calculated
with the LSC-like option (in xdraw genr op), and the result is very close to 
linear damping in test7.  A second plot shows results of
QL damping, for which an LH plateau reduces damping for all rays.


Test10 and Test10.1:  MAST EBW O-X-B test case.
====================

Test case for CD with EBW, which is propagated into MASTU
through O-X-B conversion.
The rays are launched from a disk, using raypatt='diskdisk'.
The O-X conversion occurs outside of LCFS at the omega=omega_pe layer.
The effect of an exponential drop-off density profile outside the LCFS 
is included using the new option istep_in_lcfs=0 in genray.in.
istep_in_lcfs=0 means: Start ray-tracing directly from {rst,zst} even
if it is far outside of the LCFS, until omega=omegape is encountered. 
That is, there no stepping along the straight-line ray characteristic 
from rst,zst until inside LCFS, as in the prior istep_in_lcfs=1 (the default) 
model.

(Ref: test_MAST_EBW/)
A paired cql3d test case is in  cql3d/00_Cql3d_Regression_Tests/test4.
