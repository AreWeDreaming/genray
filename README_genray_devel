Compiled latest genray at
viz:/u/bharvey/genray_cvs/VIZ_genray_v7-2_080423/xgenray

See viz:/u/bharvey/genray_cvs/Coupling_to_PS
for README_onetwo-genray and some coding concerning
previous coupling of genray to ONETWO transport code.

GENRAY side of coupling is mainly in 
viz:/u/bharvey/genray_cvs/VIZ_genray_v7-2_080423/partner.f
We have, from genray.in namelist file:
!--------------------------------------------------------------------------
! partner  = 'disabled' to use input profiles from genray.dat or genray.in
!          = 'genray_profs_in.nc'  to use plasma profile data from the netCDF
!                       file: genray_profs_in.nc  created by transport code
!                       or otherwise;
!                  and to output power and current profiles on transport
!                      code radial grid to file: genray_profs_out.nc
!                      and genray_profs_out.txt (text file).
!          = 'genray_profs_in.txt'  to use plasma profile data from the text
!                      file: genray_profs_in.txt  created by transport code
!                      or otherwise;
!                  and to output power and current profiles on transport
!                      code radial grid to file: genray_profs_out.nc
!                      and genray_profs_out.txt (text file).
!------------------------------------------------------------------------


Start with partner='genray_profs_in.txt' for initial coupling
to plasma state.

prepare_genray_input.f90 will write genray_profs_in.txt/.nc using
PS data.  
process_genray_output.f90 will read genray_profs_out.txt/.nc [from
genray], and put the power deposition and current drive in the PS.

May 9, 2008
===========

For prepare_genray_input.f/process_genray_output.f start from
/p/swim1/berryla/ips/trunk/components/fp/rfmin/cql3d/prepare_fp_rfmin_cql3d_input.f and  process_fp_rfmin_cql3d_output.f
==>  prepare_genray_input.f/process_genray_output.f

contains coding used  for coupling genray to onetwo [write of
           genray_profs_in.txt/genray_profs_in.nc
	   and reaad of genray_profs_out.txt/genray_profs_out.nc]

read_write_genray_input.f: From genray

See Smirnov email, 03/10/07 07:17 am, re
Latest genray with declaration of namelist variables


May 16, 2008
============
Have compiled version of prepare_genray_input.f90, on viz.
Accesses plasma state, and reads all genray namelist.
Working with Doug McCune to interpolate electrons and alla
ion species (abridged impurities, but complete) radial
density and temperature profiles to bin
boundaries, for passage to genray through genray_profs_in.txt and .nc
files.  For cases where electron and Zeff profiles are sufficient
(EC, EBW), don't need ion profiles.  For other cases (ICRF, HHFW, LH)
need ions.   Use abridged impurities (up to two impurities).
Will also have beam, RF minority, and fusion product nonthermal
distributions.   Allowing for extreme cases, we compile genray
for up to 11 ion species (12 species total, including electrons).




May 20, 2008
============

Adapting coding by McCune for gathering all ion species into a single
array of densities and temperatures, to transfer to genray_profs_in file.


May 23, 2008
============

The main complication in application of the Plasma State to genray
coupling is use of the abridged species set.  In general the plasma
state may provide data for a much larger list of ions--- perhaps
including multiple charge states of several impurities--- than is
desireable to be treated in genray.   The abridged set of ions reduces
the impurity species to .le.2 species, conserving Zeff and charge
neutrality.
See Abridged_Species_PS2.pdf, Abridged_PS2_ps_tha_summary.pdf,
McCune_frm_080516.eml, McCune_frm_080523.eml.

July 17, 2008
=============
Have working prepare_genray_input.f90.4 
and          process_genray_output.f90.3,
and
three sets of tests:
Cmod_LH/ ITER_EC_Budny/ NSTX_FW
[Have not worked yet on the D3D_ECCD case].

A new read_write_genray_input.f (old designated read_write_genray_input.f.0)
will be incorporated into prepare_genray_input.f90(.5).
The new read_write_genray_input.f simplifies (modularizes, i.e. separate
subroutines) the treatment of switching from mixed units (genray.dat 
conventions used in genray) to genray.in MKSA units.

The codes will also be updated to genray version="genray_v7-6_080714".
(The only change in the includes is the version parameter in param.i.)



Updating read_write_genray_input.f from genray distribution
===========================================================
-Move present read_write_genray_input.f to read_write_genray_input.f_xxxxxx
 where xxxxx is file date.
-Copy read_write_genray_input.f from distn to pwd.
-Compare new and old versions to check changes look OK. Don't forget to
 comment out indicated region.
-cd genray_includes, and diff with distn.   Update from distn.


August 31, 2008
===============
Updated prepare_genray_input.f90/process_genray_output.f90.
read_write_genray_input.f is from latest genray_v7-8_080801 (passes
regression tests, and including propagation outside LCFS).
[freqncy for EC case changed in PS from MHz to GHz.  Other small
changes].

Updated genray_includes/

Update tests/ITER_EC_Budny/test_1src

Other EC variables have been added to the PS Version_ID 2.011,
as indicated by runtime messages.   
Need an updated PS to apply these changes with, before modifying
prepare_genray_input.f90.

Other tests need re-checking.


Oct. 8, 2008
============

Bugs fixed in genray, per a_change.i in the distribution
in genray_v7-11_081007.tar.gz.

Putting this distribution in 
/p/swim1/bharvey/ips/trunk/components/rf/genray/genray
[i.e., ../genray], and adding it to SWIM svn repository.

Updating prepare_genray_input.f90 to frequencies in Hz,
for EC/LH/IC components for Plasma State PSv2.014,
per McCune Email, Oct. 9, 2008.



Oct. 10, 2008
=============
Created svn subdirectories in the genray directory:
trunk branches tags.  Also mpi subdirectory in trunk.
The genray files should rather be in genray/trunk,
per new SWIM convention (and standard svn convention).
But, on viz.pppl.gov  could not "svn move" files from
the svn genray subdirectory to genray/trunk/, 
per email from Wael.

Jan. 29, 2009
=============
With help from Wael, carried out "svn mv" on checked out
genray version on franklin.nersc.gov [above Oct. 10,2008 
problem persisted on viz;  maybe the svn version is too old/].

In franklin:~u650
svn co https://cswim.org/svn/cswim/genray
[Using user bharvey and password] 
cd genray
svn move *.f trunk
svn mv mpi/* trunk/mpi
Etc., for other files, moves files in local area.
svn commit   [moves the files in the svn repository]


USEFUL SVN COMMANDS:
====================
bob8: doc_svn[primary reference] and doc_svn0[wiki overview]
Checkout genray example: svn co https://cswim.org/svn/cswim/genray 
Get contents of the current ips/trunk directory on the repository:
  svn ls https://cswim.org/svn/cswim/ips/trunk
  or, view https://cswim.org/svn/cswim/ips/trunk
To open up empty ips directory [except .svn], and down the tree to genray:
  svn --depth=empty co https://cswim.org/svn/cswim/ips/trunk my_ips_trunk
     [the --depth=empty stops co of rest of tree]
  cd my_ips_trunk
  svn --depth=empty update components
  cd components
  svn --depth=empty update rf
  cd rf
  svn update genray
When committing new material, useful commands are:
  svn status -u
  svn status -v



Feb. 2, 2009
============
*Updated /u0/u/u650/genray/trunk to genray_v7-14_090130 from bob8.
 Check a_change.i for latest code modifications/additions.
*Compiled with pathscale compiler, with makefiles:
 makefile_franklin_pathscale, or,
 makefile_nowrite_franklin_pathscale  [Gives much less screen dump
                                       version of genray: xgenray_nowrite]
                                      [First need to do make in ./mpi/]
*Added 00_Genray_Regression_Tests.tar.gz_081010 to trunk/.
 tar xfvz 00_Genray_Regression_Tests.tar.gz_081010 
 gives 00_Genray_Regression_Tests/ which contains a README
 describing a set of regression tests.  The tests can be
 executed using commands in script file tests, and use the
 xdraw plotting program.

*Added xdraw.tar.gz and xdraw_inputs.tar.gz to trunk.  
 tar xfvz xdraw.tar.gz gives the ./xdraw subdirectory.
 Compile with make -f makefile_franklin [Req'd change of lib/
 to lib64/ library reference.]
 Untarring xdraw_inputs.tar.gz gives ./xdraw_inputs.  These
 input files in conjunction with xdraw give screen plotting of
 binary output files from genray [in cwd of genray execution].
 Additional commands to xdraw are output to screen when "k" is
 typed in a xdraw viewport.

*Checkout out version on bob8 passes the 7 regression tests.
 

April 8, 2009
=============
Have added functionality for poloidal variation of density
in the SOL, for propagation in the SOL, and reflection from
the plasma vacuum chamber.  Also, the vacuum chamber wall is plotted
in the plasma cross-section, when present.

New version designated version="genray_v7-16_090406".  For additional
changes, see a_change.i.   Updating in svn trunk/ and added tagged
version.

Sept 1, 2009
============
version='genray_v8-1_090901'.
A substantial portion of the code has been converted
to dynamic dimensioning based directly on namelist input
specified functionality and specific namelist derived array
sizes.  For Regression test3, for example, required total
memory is a test case was reduced from 1887 MB to 442 MB.
For test8 (using adj memory hog) total memory was reduced 
from 1892 MB to 775 MB.  the upper memory size was due to
parameter=based oversized memory allocation.
Fixed couple of small bugs.
See a_change.i.
Satisfies all test[1-8] regressions.
Committed revision 1875.

Jan. 4, 2010
============
version='genray_v8-_20100104'.
Improved detection of LCFS, so can get very
close to the separatrix.   This slightly changed
the regression tests.   There are visible differences
in test7, the C-Mod LH test case, although no
changes in the general results.

Feb. 15, 2010
=============
GENRAY has been updated on pppl portal cluster, at
/u/bharvey/genray_cvs/genray_cswim_svn/trunk/xgenray and xgenray_nowrite
and for the SWIM project on viz.pppl.gov at
/p/swim1/bharvey/cswim/genray/trunk/xgenray and xgenray_nowrite.
At svn revision 2300.




March 26, 2010
==============
Remade cql3d on franklin (after franklin OS updated) and did a:
make -f makefile clean; make -f makefile; make -f makefile install 



May 7, 2010
===========
Added defaults for all namelist, so can run with empty namelist
input file.  Added screen printout of all parameters.
version="genray_v8_3_20100507"

Dec. 11, 2010
=============
Bug fix in limiter.f [SAP].



Dec. 13, 2010
=============
GENRAY has been updated on pppl portal cluster, at
/u/bharvey/genray_cvs/genray_cswim_svn/trunk/xgenray and xgenray_nowrite
and for the SWIM project on viz.pppl.gov at
/p/swim1/bharvey/cswim/genray/trunk/xgenray and xgenray_nowrite.
At svn revision 2915.



March 8, 2011
=============
version='genray_v8_4_20110308'
Plotting changes/bug fixes, and change of real*4 cold plasma
group vel to real*8 (causing problem in TRANSP system use of genray).
Incorporates recent mods by Smirnov.  See a_change.i.
Updated in cswim svn, revision: 3121


Aug. 2, 2011
============
version='genray_v8_4_20110418'
Fixed bug in cone_ec.f power pattern, following
input from Tom Jenkins.  Narrowed power pattern somewhat.


Sept. 20, 2011
==============
version='genray_v9.0_w_lsc-option_110801'
Major additions to the code:
  - LSC 1D-in-vpar FP determination of LHCD,
    following the approach in D.W. Ignat, E.J. Valeo,
    and S.C. Jardin, Nucl. Fusion 34, 837 (1994).
  - Density and temperature outside the LCFS can now be entered
    via an external file.  This data is bi-cubic-splined in genray
    and used in the ray tracing.  A file can be output of density
    and temperature throughout the RZ plane, this file can be
    modified for use outside the LCFS, and read back in for further
    See namelist variable i_edge_dens_rz_mesh.

Bug fixes of little consequence. [See a_change.i]

Added 00_Genray_Regression_Tests/, which will be updated
from time to time.

Two new tests are included: [see 00_Genray_Regression_Tests/README]
test7_edge_dens_rz: tests of new method for modifying the
    edge density outside the LCFS.
test9: The genray run produces plots of QL damping on Maxwellian as calculated
with the LSC-like option, and the result is very close to 
linear damping in test7.  A second set of plots show results of
QL damping, for which an LH plateau reduces damping for all rays.


Remaking genray on franklin and did a:
make -f makefile clean; make -f makefile; make -f makefile install 

Ran several tests [test1 test2 test7_edge_dens_rz] on hopper
with xgenray_pgi.hopper xgenray_pathscale.hopper.
Linking xgenray to xgenray_pathscale.hopper.


Sept. 29, 2011:
Having problem with following, as
read_write_genray_input_prep make has been complicated by
addition of rz-mesh outside LCFS.
Remading genray on hopper and did a:
make -f makefile_swim clean; make -f makefile_swim; make -f makefile_swim
install
BUT, didn't complete, as additional non-namelist material has
been included in read_write_genray_input_prep.f.  Need to clean
it up.


Nov. 1, 2011
Code version="genray_v10.0_111101".
Cleanup of read_write_genray_input_prep.f, so that it only
(almost) includes namelist material.
Also, have added option to write/read general density/
temperature/zeff outside the LCFS on an R,Z mesh to/from
an ascii file.

Did a makefile_swim clean, makefile_swim, makefile_swim install.
Code in
/global/homes/u/u650/my_ips_trunk/components/rf/genray/src
compiles with the make ips.


Nov. 9, 2011
Code version="genray_v10.0_111109".
Fixed bug in read_write_genray_input.f:
zeff1 incorrectly being written back into genray.in,
relevant for partner.ne.'disabled'.  Can affect
coupling to SWIM IPS.


c---------------------------------------------------------------------
June 29, 2012
=============
Code version="genray_v10.2_120629".
Updated from
version gr120629.tar.gz of genray which contains a few
modifications of Smirnov latest genray, gr120605.tar.gz,
sent out on June 5, 2012.

Bugs and compiler issues which have been fixed can 
be seen by comparison with your previous file set.
Changes have been made in
rside1.f:  comment on line cSAP111119 test removed
emission_spectrum.f:  Some rewriting of memory allocation
  to get code running with the Intel compiler, for test 5.
lin_liu_curnt.f:  remove couple of f90 line continuation &
    that confuse compiler in some cases.
dinit.f:  subroutine arg list incompatibility
forest.f  subroutine arg list incompatibility
oxb.f  subroutine arg list incompatibility

read_write_genray_input_prep.f has been made compatible
with read_write_genray_input.f.

The rside1.f problem shows that, interestingly enough,
no one has run the regressions tests since at least
111119.   The dinit.f/forest.f/oxb.f were previous fixed,
but somehow didn't make it into your file set.

This version also contains Nicola Bertelli version of
Bonoli LH scattering. Some further additions from
Bertelli are yet to be incorporated.

This version properly executed all 00_Genray_Regression_Tests/.
Several regression tests were run at stix.pppl.gov and
portal.pppl.gov, including test5, ITER ECCD.

c[164] file.  To be used with SWIM IPS.  [BH, 111212].

c----------------------------------------------------------------------

Sept 12, 2013
=============
Recent development:


c[170] Added delim='apostrophe', in several open() of namelist files, 
c[170] to ensure that any namelist writes include apostrophe delimiters in
c[170] the character variables. Default for PGI and Intel compilers
c[170] is delim='none'. [BH 130911].

c[169] version="genray_v10.4_130726",  YuP+BH re-implemented MPI.
c[169] The MPI feature had been broken during introduction of 
c[169] dynamic dimensioning, item [162] and ongoing re-dimensioning.

Oct. 25, 2013
=============

c[172] version="genray_v10.5_131024"
c[172] Modified character length of 512 character variables down

==============
c[175] version="genray_v10.7_140801"
c[175] Added momentum conservation in the Lin-Liu subroutine
c[175] (lin-liu_curnt.f), controlled by new namelist variable 
c[175] ieffic_mom_cons (which works with ieffic=4).
c[175] The implementation is the same as the implementation done
c[175] in the TORBEAM code. More specifically, the model is described
c[175] in Marushchenko et al, PoP 18, 032501 (2011) and Marushchenko
c[175] et al, NF 48, 054002 (2008). [Nicola Bertelli, 140716]

c[174] Fixed write of lsc-approach, per Andre and F. Poli.
c[174] Made adjustments to template file, for clarity.
c[174] Added three test cases (test8.1-3) comparing various methods
c[174] for calculation of O-mode ITER ECCD. New  ieffic=4,ieffic_mom_cons=1
c[174] compares well with ieffic=6/i_adj ADJ calcs  and CQL3D calcs.
c[174] Adjusted makefiles regarding new ieffic-mon-cons .f90 files.
c[174] [BH140729]

c[173] version="genray_v10.6_140421"
c[173] Several small bugs which affected execution/use at PPPL were
c[173] fixed according to Rob Andre presecriptions [BH140421].

Also, added new regression tests (test8.1,test8.2,test8.3) comparing
results ITER O-mode ECCD for different current drive calculations. [BH140730]

==========================================================================

From Nicola Bertelli, re momentum conservation in ieffic=4 Linliu
EC current drive calculation:

In this GENRAY's version I have included the momentum conservation in the 
Lin-Liu subroutine (lin-liu_curnt.f) as it has been done in TORBEAM and 
TRAVIS codes. More specifically, the model is described in Marushchenko 
et al, PoP 18, 032501 (2011) and Marushchenko et al, NF 48, 054002 (2008).
I have copied the modifications in the Lin-Liu subroutine done by E. Poli 
(IPP) in TORBEAM code.

Here below a list of modifications:

1) copy 4 subroutines from TORBEAM:
   - const_and_precisions.f90
   - quanc8.f90
   - config_ext.f90
   - green_func_ext.f90

2) Add in F90SRCS of makefile_pathscale_portal_pppl the following routines/modules:
   - const_and_precisions.f90
   - quanc8.f90
   - config_ext.f90
   - green_func_ext.f90

3) modified lin_liu_curnt.f subroutine (see !N Bertelli) including changes from
   TORBEAM code (more specifically, from subroutine TorGA_curgap.f90 of TORBEAM)
   - In the end of the original lin_liu_curnt.f I have added a new subroutine (green_func_emp) 
     from TORBEAM and I commented 3 lines where there was INCLUDE 

4) commented one line in green_func_ext.f90 (see ! N Bertelli)

5) I have included "ieffic_mom_cons = 0" in read_write_genray_input.f together with 
   its definition in the comments 

6) I have included "ieffic_mom_cons = 0" in read_write_genray_input_prep.f together with 
   its definition in the comments

7) I have added "ieffic_mom_cons" in name_tokamak.i

8) I have added "ieffic_mom_cons" in one_nml.i

9) I have created a new input template file "genray.in_template_MKSA_111031_nb"
   where I have added the new flag "ieffic_mom_cons" together with its definition

==========================================================================



Nicola Bertelli (2014-07-16) added momentum conservation ieffic_mom_cons=1
into ieffic=4 Lin_Liu (TorGA_curgap subroutine), according to
Marushchenko et al, NF 48, 054002 (2008).  BH added to 00_Regression_Tests,
test8.1-3, giving results as follows:

test	   descrptn				Comp. time		Curr(kA)
test8      i_adj=1 ADJ-bases self adjoint,	2m52s with adj calc	25.8
           momentum conserving.	  		4s, existing adj calc
test8.1	   ieffic=4, ieffic_mom_cons=1		0.60s			25.5
test8.2	   ieffic=4, ieffic_mom_cons=0		0.60s			13.0
test8.3	   ieffic=3, Curba (Cohen) subroutine 	0.59s			10.1
	   (high vel approx, sq-well-B)
Definitely, test8.1 setup is preferable for this type of run.	




July 30, 2014
=============
CompX3: svn commit
Substantial number of files added and modified.
Committed revision 4087.



Aug 1, 2014
===========
makefile_nowrite_pathscale_portal_pppl
makefile_pathscale_portal_pppl
both work on portal at pppl.
Get mpi executable with makefile_mpi_pathscale_portal_pppl and openmpi,
but doesn't properly exectute (00_Genray_Regression_Tests/test7).
Same fileset gives proper execution at CompX2, with gfortran and mpich2.


Sept 10, 2014
=============
c[176] version="genray_v10.8_140909"
c[176] Added immediate stopping of a ray, if initial power is zero
c[176] [.lt.1.e-100], to save compute time. iray_status_nc=14. 
c[176] [BH140909].

Ray data is still inserted in the genray.nc for these zero-power rays,
but all delpwr are 0, nrayelt() is set to 1 for each ray, starting
density/temperature, etc. at first ray element is given.
Prior to this mod, the ray trajectories were computed for all rays,
including the zero power rays.

Put into svn as revision 4100.


October 24, 2014  
================
Code version="genray_v10.8_141024"
MPI is revised and now is in good working condition.
Added momentum conservation in the Lin-Liu subroutine.
Added immediate stopping of a ray, if initial power is zero [<1.e-100].
More details - see a_change.i records[170-178]


June 2015
=========
Bug fixes by YuP (see a_change.1).

Oct. 18, 2015
=============
Augmentation of ECCD calc for multiple harmonic cases added
(with Bertelli).   Bug fix of temperature outside the LCFS
(with Syunichi Shiraiwa).
version="genray_v10.10_151018"



170720
======
genray_cswim_svn/trunk/ brought up to date with
genray_170301_updtd170720.zip



180125
======
Using version="genray_v10.11_170725": The 13 regression tests
ran OK on linux machine[BH].  Installing on nersc edison in
/global/homes/u/u650/genray_cswim_svn/genray_v10.11_170725.
Adjusted edison makefiles and compiled and loaded.
Tested the serial version with couple of regression tests
(not the mpi version).
Made backup of ../trunk in ../trunk_to_180125, and copied all
genray_v10.11_170725/ files to ../trunk (i.e., updated trunk).

Apr 10, 2018
============
Put in to git version control on CompX2:~/cql3d/git_genray
========================================
version="genray_v10.11_180410"  
Otherwise, little changed from "genray_v10.11_170725".


180616
======
Updated to version="genray_v10.12_180529" in git/genray and pushed to github.com
YuP has added three namelists variables to control code output:
outnetcdf (to suppress writing data to *.nc)
outprint (to suppress printing to the screen)
outxdraw (to suppress saving files for xdraw).

BH ran the 16 regression tests ==>  No issues.


180906-8
========
Recompiled genray, serial and mpi versions, on edison.
Added an test7.mpi MPI test into 00_Genray_Regression_Tests/


180912
======
version="genray_v10.12_180912"
Fixed bugs related to MPI implementation 
of ADJ-related subroutines (i_adj=1).
The bugs resulted in zero current. 
With this fix, the file 'adjout' (usually a large file)
is only recordered by one core (myrank=0), and 
read also by one core, and then MPI-broadcasted to other cores.
See "write (iout5,...)" and "read (iout5,...)".
YuP[2018-09-12].

YuP ran tests with MPI on a iadj=1 test case from Francesca Poli.
BH ran all 15 00_Genray_Regression_Tests/ regression tests.
