In the source distribution, there is a file
genray.in_template_MKSA_111031 [or later date]
which gives the latest description of the input namelist.
This can give some idea of code capabilities.

In the regression test file, 00_Genray_Regression_Tests_nnnnnn.tar
there are about a dozen regressions tests, as described
in the README.   These can be executed with the commands
in file tests.

You will need to have xdraw and executable, obtained with the
makefile in genray_cswim_svn/trunk/xdraw/  It is in c, and compiles
without additional libraries, so, almost everywhere.
I make a alias to the xdraw1 executable to xdraw.

There is a brief code description at 
http://www.compxco.com/genray.html
and a manual at the bottom of this page.

There is also a IPS test case for LH at
hopper09:/global/homes/u/u650/my_ips_trunk/components/rf/genray/src/\
tests/Cmod_LH/one_ray_111106_newPS

ls -lt make_archive/* gives a sort of history of the compilers and computers
with which genray has been compiled, including dates.  The newer ones
will work with the present distribution.
