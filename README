Aug. 19, 2013
=============
Adjusted makefile_mpi.gfortran64.bob9.CentOS for mpich2.
On bob9 installation, with mpich2, version 2.1, had to start
the mpd demon, then run with mppiexec:
mpd &   This starts a deamon, which handles the some security issues.
mpiexec -np 4

Sept. 11, 2013
==============
Removed the cntrl-M line endings from about 20 .f and .i files, which
come in when Yuri editted from mpi with windows.

Updated read_write_genray_input_prep.f from read_write_genray_input.f.
Will need to add
     common/mpimyrank/myrank !In serial run: myrank=0; In MPI run: myrank=rank
     data myrank/0/  !In serial run: myrank=0; In MPI run: myrank=rank
when invoking read_write_genray_input_prep.f from prepare_genray_input.f90.
This will be serial code, so set myrank=0 as default.

Added
delim='apostrophe',
in several open() of namelist files, to ensure that
any namelist writes include apostrophe delimiters in
the character variables.
This also solves a problem with long namelist character
variables when writing and reading namelists using the
INTEL and PGI compilers.


July 16, 2014
=============
Added momentum conservation in the Lin-Liu subroutine
c[175] (lin-liu_curnt.f), controlled by new namelist variable 
c[175] ieffic_mom_cons (which works with ieffic=4).  Same as
done in TORBEAM, per Marushchenko et al, PoP 18, 032501 (2011).


Mar 1, 2017
===========
This version, "genray_v10.10_170301", from CompX2 trunk/.
Ran the 00_Genray_Regression_Tests test suite (15 tests).
All looked OK.


Jul 25, 2017
============
version="genray_v10.11_170725"
Adjustment of ioxm procedure for picking roots of the cold
plasma dispersion.   Also, adjustment of meaning of ib namelist.
See a_change.i.
NOTE:   ioxm_n_par was previously introduced as an alternative to ioxm,
        to help resolve ambiguity in the effects of ioxm.


Apr 10, 2018
============
Put in to git version control on CompX2.
========================================
version="genray_v10.11_180410"  
Otherwise, little changed from "genray_v10.11_170725".


Sept 6, 2018
============
Obtained genray distribution from https://github.com/compxco/genray
and compiled, placing updated files in trunk/ .

Sept 12, 2018
=============
Obtained a few changes related to YuP fix of MPI error in the
ADJ calculation of LH current drive efficiency (was OK in the
serial genray version).  See a_change.i
version="genray_v10.12_180912"
